#### Duration of Sprint: 1 + 15 hours week

#### Moderation

The backlog for Sprint 1, issue#8; Receive Messages Sent in Group Chat cause integration issues and delayed overall progress hence was not delivered for sprint 1 but
should be delivered for sprint 2. issue #4; Send a "Join Group" Invitation to Another Student was not implemented due to the need to work in pair with teammate 
which was difficult under time constraints. Functionality must be achieved for sprint 2.

#### Goal: 
A solution is achieved however the deployment does not produce the content and major improvement in terms of integration, code fluidity and user experience
needs to be looked upon to improve the application to the desired standard.
