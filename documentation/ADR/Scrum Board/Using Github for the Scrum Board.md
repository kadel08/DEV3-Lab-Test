# 1. Use of GitHub's Project Management feature for the Scrum Board

Date: 2021-06-02

## Status

Accepted 

## Context

A SCRUM-based agile devlopment workflow would benefit from a Scrum board to keep track of user stories that have been written in the story map - those that are in progress, and are complete. This will help identify the sprint backlog, and the current focus of the sprint. Labels could be used to and determine what can get done inside a single sprint.

## Decision

Using the GitHib Project features with a single project for the repo, and using Issues labelled as User-Story and developer-story. The sprint Scrum board had four columns for "To Do", "In progress", "Peer Review" and "Completed". We leveraged some of the automatic rules in Github to help automate opening, closing and reviewing upon pull request of tasks for each sprint. The Scrum Board for each sprint can be found at https://github.com/witseie-elen4010/2021-012-project/projects 

## Consequences

A digital user story map was designed as a guide for the sprints in the Scrum board. It will be reviewed after the end of each sprint.

 * makes it easy to plan for the next sprint and to review the sprint
 * makes it easy to assign one user story to a single individual 
 * makes it easy to modify  the user stories
